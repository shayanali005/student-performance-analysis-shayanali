# 🎓 Student Performance Data Analysis
**Author:** Shayan Ali  
**Level:** Beginner  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This beginner-friendly data science project explores how gender, parental education, and test preparation influence student exam performance.  
We analyze patterns in Math, Reading, and Writing scores and predict whether a student will score above average in Math.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and exploration
- Visualize relationships between demographic factors and scores
- Build a logistic regression model to predict high-performing students
- Evaluate the model using accuracy metrics

---

## 🛠️ Dataset
The dataset contains **1,000 student records**, each with:  
- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental Level of Education  
- Lunch Type  
- Test Preparation Course  
- Math, Reading, and Writing Scores  

**File:** `StudentsPerformance.csv`

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Students who completed test preparation courses tend to score higher.  
- Parental education level positively impacts student performance.  
- Math, reading, and writing scores are strongly correlated.

---

## 🤖 Model Summary
- Model Used: Logistic Regression  
- Target: Whether math score ≥ 70 (Above Average)  
- Accuracy: ~89%
